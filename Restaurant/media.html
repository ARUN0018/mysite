            <tr><td><img src="download.jpg" ></td>
                <td><p>Fine dining restaurants occupy the peak position when it comes to formality and price. The style of fine dining service is an age-old tradition with many rules and nuances. There are extra little touches that you won't find in any other type of restaurant, like when a server "crumbs" the table to remove any crumbs from the tablecloth. Even guests are expected to follow a dress code when dining out at an upscale establishment. This gives fine dining an exclusive feel and makes it a treat reserved for special occasions, such as an anniversary, a birthday, or a wedding. A fine dining menu will feature items that you wouldn't eat every day, like caviar, steak tartare, or foie gras.</p></td>
            <table>
            <h2>CASUAL RESTAURANT</h2>
            <tr> <td><p>A casual restaurant offers full-service dining, where guests are seated and waited on by the server staff. But unlike more formal dining rooms, casual restaurants provide roomy, comfortable seating and a laid-back atmosphere. Menus contain comfort foods and items that are tried and true. You won't find experimental cuisine and trendy decor at a casual restaurant. Diners, mom-and-pops, and many popular chain restaurants are considered casual dining restaurants.</p></td>
            <td><img src="images.jpg"></td></tr><br></table>
            <table><h2>BUFFET RESTAURANT</h2>
            <tr><td><img src="Family.jpg"></td>
            <td><p>The next type of restaurant on our list is the all-you-can-eat buffet. A buffet restaurant operates differently than other eateries. Instead of a menu, buffets are distinguished by self-serve food stations where guests can fill their plates as many times as they like for a flat price. Instead of cooking dishes to order, buffet cooks prepare large quantities of dishes that can be held in salad bar stations or hot food stations. Because of this, you won't find delicate dishes at a buffet. But you will find a large variety of comfort foods that fill guests up quickly.</p></td></tr></table><br>
