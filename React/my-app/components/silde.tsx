          &nbsp; In information technology, an application (app), an application
          program, or application software is a computer program designed to
          help people perform an activity. Depending on the activity for which
          it was designed, an application can manipulate text, numbers, audio,
          graphics, and a combination of these elements. Some application
          packages focus on a single task, such as word processing; others
          called integrated software include several applications.
